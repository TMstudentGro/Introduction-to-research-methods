# **Introduction-to-research-methods**
# **Abstract**
This is a researchproject for research methods at the RUG. Here we are tasked to find a something that is researchable with use of the Gutenberg project. I find the difference between African American Vernacular English (AAVE) and Standard English very interesting. That is why I have chosen to research certain variation of grammar in literature. 


# **Research question and Hypothesis**
*Hypothesis:*
Both the Stnd. English and AAVE have a high frequency in use of Doesn’t, but AAVE has a higher frequency in use of Don’t than Stnd. English.
