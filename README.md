# **Introduction-to-research-methods**
# **Abstract**
This is a researchproject for research methods at the RUG. Here we are tasked to find a something that is researchable with use of the Gutenberg project. I find the difference between African American Vernacular English (AAVE) and Standard English very interesting. That is why I have chosen to research certain variation of grammar in literature. 

# **Background information**
These are studies on the grammatical features of AAVE in written scripts:

# **Research question and Hypothesis**
*Research question:*
Is there a big difference between the use of Doesn’t and Don’t between Stnd. English and AAVE?
*Hypothesis:*
Both the Stnd. English and AAVE have a high frequency in use of Doesn’t, but AAVE has a higher frequency in use of Don’t than Stnd. English. 

# **Method**
I will be looking certain grammar changes. This is one of the examples I will be checking: "She doesn't like coffee." vs "She don't like coffee." That way I can focus on the specified grammar that I want to check without having false postives. I will check this in books written in AAVE and same period stnd. English. I will be checking the following literature.

*Literature:*
- Huckleberry Finn, Mark Twain (https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/76)
- Oliver Twist, Charles Dickens (https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/730)
- Other various books too.
